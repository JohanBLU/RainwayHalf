# RainwayHalf
The reasom for this repo to be a thing is because Flarf [b]demoted[/b] me from Rainway, for no reason, so i decided to leak this.

Note that Rainway still exists, but the new site is open source, and its owned by Flofy, who actually has a brain (I've never talked to him while i was co-owner, but yea)
